<h1>Interests</h1>
<p>
    Almost every evening (and sometimes during the day if there is time) I draw in my
sketchbook or, more recently with my iPad and Apple Pencil. I have always loved
drawing and greatly enjoy exercising my creativity whenever possible.
I also love to make music and have a knack for learning instruments. My favourites
are acoustic guitar and piano which I have played for many years. I have my eye on
accordion as my next musical conquest.
I enjoy being outside and when time and finances allow, I like to engage in more
adventurous activities such as skiing, shooting, mountain-bike riding and scuba.
